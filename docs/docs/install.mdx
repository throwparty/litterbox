# 📦 Installation

The application is distributed as a single `litterbox` binary, which you'll need to [download from the latest release](https://github.com/throwparty/litterbox/releases/latest) make executable and place on your `PATH`.

:::info

We're aware that placing binaries on `PATH` isn't great for versioning. Packaging is on the roadmap.

    What steps are required for you depend on your Linux distribution.

    To use our binary distribution, place it somewhere on your `PATH`. We suggest `~/.local/bin`.

    ```shell
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
    curl -L https://github.com/throwparty/litterbox/releases/download/v0.1.0/litterbox_Linux_x86_64 -o ~/.local/bin/litterbox
    chmod +x ~/.local/bin/litterbox
    ```

    Then, add the following to your shell's rc:

    ```shell
    export PATH="$PATH:~/.local/bin"
    ```
  </TabItem>

    chmod +x ~/.local/bin/litterbox

  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    To use our binary distribution, place it somewhere on your `PATH`. We suggest `~/.local/bin`.

    ```powershell
    $localBin = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE ".local" "bin"
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $localBin | Out-Null

    $dest = Join-Path $localBin "litterbox.exe"
    $url = "https://github.com/throwparty/litterbox/releases/download/v0.1.0/litterbox_Windows_x86_64.exe"
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $dest

    $oldPath = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
    if (($oldPath -split ';') -notcontains $localBin) {
      [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$oldPath;$localBin", "User")
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You now need to [set up your agent harness](category/agents) to launch the Litterbox MCP server and configure an agent that can only use Litterbox's write and exec tools.
