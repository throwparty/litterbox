# 📂 Setting up your project

Create a file in the root of your project named `.litterbox.toml` with the content:

```toml
# Optional: override the default project slug (derived from directory name)
# [project]
# slug = "my-project"

[docker]
image = "busybox:latest"
setup-command = "busybox httpd -h /src -p 0.0.0.0:8080"

[[ports]]
name = "www"
target = 8080
```

For details on what configuration options are available, see the [configuration reference](reference/config).

When a new sandbox is created, Litterbox will:

- Create a new branch named after the sandbox in your Git repository.
- Copy the source code into `/src` inside the container.
- Run the setup command to start the HTTP server.
- Assign it a random port number that forwards traffic to the HTTP server running on port 8080 in the container.
