# ADR: Docker SDK for Rust - Technical Plan

## 1. Architecture Overview

This plan focuses on evaluating existing Rust crates that provide an interface to a Docker Engine. The goal is to identify the most suitable, robust, and well-maintained crate that fulfills the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the specification. The chosen crate will then be integrated as a dependency, forming the foundation for any application requiring Docker interaction in Rust. We will not be developing a new Docker API client from scratch.

## 2. Technology Stack Justification

The core technology is **Rust**. The justification for the technology stack now centers on selecting the *best existing Rust crate* for Docker interaction. This approach leverages existing community efforts, reduces development and maintenance overhead, and ensures compatibility with the Docker Engine API.

## 3. Evaluation Criteria and Methodology

### Evaluation Criteria

I will evaluate potential Rust crates based on the following criteria, directly mapping to the specification's requirements and best practices for library selection:

1.  **Functional Coverage:**
    *   **Core (MUST have):** Create containers (FR2), Delete containers (FR3), Pull images (FR6), Execute commands in containers (FR7), Copy files into containers (FR8), Copy files out of containers (FR9).
    *   **Supplementary (SHOULD have/nice-to-have):** List containers (FR4), Start/Stop containers (FR5).
2.  **API Design & Usability (NFR4):**
    *   How idiomatic is the Rust API?
    *   Is it easy to understand and use?
    *   Does it leverage modern Rust features (e.g., async/await, traits, error handling patterns) effectively?
    *   Are there clear examples of usage?
3.  **Documentation Quality (NFR4, NFR5):**
    *   Is the `rustdoc` comprehensive and well-organized?
    *   Are there clear `README.md` and/or external guides with examples for common use cases?
    *   Is the documentation up-to-date with the latest API changes?
4.  **Project Activity & Maintenance (NFR5):**
    *   Last commit date on GitHub.
    *   Frequency of releases to `crates.io`.
    *   Number of open issues and pull requests; responsiveness of maintainers.
    *   Bus factor (number of active contributors).
5.  **Community Support:**
    *   Stars on GitHub, number of forks.
    *   Presence and activity in relevant forums (e.g., Discord, Stack Overflow, Rust community forums).
6.  **Dependencies:**
    *   Are the dependencies minimal, well-chosen, and actively maintained?
    *   Are there any known security vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies?
    *   Potential for dependency conflicts with other project crates.
7.  **License:** Compatibility with typical project licensing (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
8.  **Reliability & Error Handling (NFR2):**
    *   How robust is the crate in handling Docker Engine communication errors, network issues, and various Docker API error responses?
    *   Does it provide clear, actionable error types that can be easily matched and handled by the user?
9.  **Performance (NFR1):**
    *   While detailed benchmarking will be difficult during evaluation, I will look for any reported performance bottlenecks, known inefficiencies, or heavy resource usage in issue trackers or community discussions.
10. **Compatibility (NFR6):
    *   Does the crate explicitly state its compatibility with recent Docker Engine API versions?
    *   How frequently is it updated to support new Docker features or API changes?

### Evaluation Methodology

1.  **Discovery:** I will perform targeted searches on `crates.io` and GitHub for keywords such as "rust docker client", "rust docker api", "rust docker sdk", "bollard", "docker-api".
2.  **Initial Filtering:** Quickly identify and discard crates that:
    *   Are clearly unmaintained (e.g., last commit > 2 years ago).
    *   Lack the majority of the core functional requirements.
    *   Have incompatible licenses.
    *   Are experimental or highly niche.
3.  **Shortlisting Candidates:** Select a small number (e.g., 2-3) of the most promising crates for detailed review.
4.  **Detailed Review for Each Candidate:**
    *   **Codebase Scan:** Examine `Cargo.toml` for dependencies. Review `src/lib.rs` and key modules to understand the API structure.
    *   **Documentation Analysis:** Thoroughly read the `README.md` and `rustdoc` for completeness, clarity, and examples.
    *   **GitHub Activity Check:** Analyze commit history, release tags, open/closed issues, and pull requests to gauge project health and maintainer responsiveness.
    *   **Community Footprint:** Look for discussions, tutorials, or projects using the crate.
    *   **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Implementation (Optional but Recommended):** For the top 1-2 candidates, write small, focused Rust programs to implement each of the "Core (MUST have)" functional requirements. This hands-on approach will directly validate API usability, functional correctness, and error handling.
5.  **Comparative Analysis:** Create a structured report or table summarizing each shortlisted crate's performance against the evaluation criteria.
6.  **Recommendation:** Based on the comprehensive analysis, provide a clear recommendation for the most suitable Rust crate, along with strong justifications.

## 4. Component Breakdown

This section is not applicable to an evaluation plan. The "components" of the solution will effectively be the selected external crate and its internal structure, which will be detailed in a subsequent plan if we proceed with implementation based on a chosen crate.

## 5. Data Flow Diagrams

This section is not applicable to an evaluation plan. Data flow will be dictated by the chosen crate's internal mechanisms, which are outside the scope of this evaluation.

## 6. Testing Strategy

The testing strategy during this evaluation phase will focus on validating the chosen crate's functionality and its suitability against our requirements.

-   **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Tests:**
    *   For the most promising candidate crates, develop minimal, self-contained Rust applications.
    *   These PoCs will specifically exercise all "Core (MUST have)" functional requirements (create, delete, pull, exec, copy in/out).
    *   The PoCs will be run against a **locally running Docker Engine** to ensure real-world interaction and detect any integration issues.
-   **Error Handling Validation:** The PoCs will also include scenarios designed to trigger known error conditions (e.g., non-existent image pull, exec in a stopped container) to assess the crate's error reporting and clarity.
-   **Compatibility Checks:** The PoCs will explicitly target the Docker Engine API versions specified as compatible by the crate.

## 7. Deployment Considerations

Deployment considerations during this evaluation phase will focus on how the *chosen crate* will impact the deployability and maintainability of our future Rust application.

-   **Integration Effort:** How seamlessly does the chosen crate integrate into a standard Rust project using `Cargo`?
-   **Runtime Dependencies:** Are there any unusual or problematic runtime dependencies for the chosen crate?
-   **Binary Size:** Does the crate significantly increase the final application's binary size?
-   **Security Updates:** How frequently does the chosen crate receive security updates, and how easy is it to update to newer versions?
-   **Cross-Platform Support:** Confirm that the chosen crate explicitly supports Linux, macOS, and Windows environments, matching the Docker Engine's typical deployment platforms.
-   **Licensing Compliance:** Ensure that the chosen crate's license is compatible with the overall project's licensing.
