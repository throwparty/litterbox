*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
*   After a successful `write` operation, an SCM snapshot is automatically created.
*   After a successful `patch` operation, an SCM snapshot is automatically created.
*   After a successful `bash` command that modifies the filesystem, an SCM snapshot is automatically created.
*   Snapshots are only created when `git status` reports changes.

    *   The main development branch remains unaffected by agent snapshots.
*   **Test Requirements:**
