# PoC: prism-mcp-rs Implementation

**SDK**: prism-mcp-rs v1.1.2  
**Repository**: https://github.com/prismworks-ai/prism-mcp-rs  
**Status**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASS  
**Production Readiness**: ⚠️ TOO NEW - Only 5 months old

## Test Results

```
[TEST 1] Initialize MCP connection ✓
[TEST 2] List available tools ✓
[TEST 3] Write file with absolute path ✓
[TEST 4] Write file with relative path (should fail) ✓

All tests passed! ✓
```

## Implementation Summary

**Lines of Code**: 90 lines (comparable to rmcp at 89 lines)

**API Style**: Builder pattern with async methods
- Clean, straightforward API
- Uses `add_tool()` method to register handlers
- Trait-based handler implementation

**Key Code Pattern**:
```rust
#[async_trait]
impl ToolHandler for WriteFileHandler {
    async fn call(&self, arguments: HashMap<String, Value>) -> McpResult<ToolResult> {
        // Handler logic
    }
}

let mut server = McpServer::new("name", "version");
server.add_tool(name, description, schema, handler).await?;
server.start(StdioServerTransport::new()).await
```

## Dependencies

```toml
prism-mcp-rs = { version = "1.1", features = ["stdio"] }
async-trait = "0.1.89"
tokio = { version = "1.49.0", features = ["full"] }
serde_json = "1.0.149"
```

**Total crates in tree**: 160 packages (significantly more than rmcp)

## API Design

### Error Handling
Uses descriptive error constructors:
- `McpError::validation()` - for invalid parameters
- `McpError::internal()` - for runtime errors
- Other: `protocol()`, `transport()`, `connection()`, etc.

### Type System
- `HashMap<String, Value>` for arguments (requires manual extraction)
- `ToolResult` with `ContentBlock` for responses
- `McpServer` builder pattern

### Tool Registration
```rust
server.add_tool(
    "write_file",
    Some("description"),
    json!(schema),  // Manual JSON schema
    WriteFileHandler,
).await?;
```

## Ergonomics Assessment

### Positives
- Clean builder API
- Descriptive error types
- Good type names (`validation`, `internal` vs `invalid_request`, `internal_error`)
- Async-first design

### Negatives
- Manual argument extraction from `HashMap<String, Value>`
- No automatic schema generation from Rust types
- Requires manual JSON schema construction
- More verbose than macro-based approaches (rmcp)

## Production Concerns

### Critical Issues

1. **Too New (5 months old)**
   - First release: August 2025
   - Latest release: December 27, 2025
   - Unknown stability track record
   - Breaking changes likely

2. **Small Community**
   - Only 42 GitHub stars
   - Limited adoption
   - Fewer eyes on code quality
   - Less community support

3. **Heavy Marketing**
   - README heavily emphasizes "enterprise-grade" and "production-ready"
   - Claims seem premature for such a young library
   - Many advanced features (plugins, circuit breakers, etc.) unproven

4. **Dependency Weight**
   - 160 packages in dependency tree
   - More complex than rmcp (official SDK)
   - Larger attack surface

### Feature Complexity
While the SDK advertises many "enterprise" features:
- Hot-reloadable plugins
- Circuit breakers
- HTTP/2, compression
- Health checks
- OpenTelemetry

Most of these are **not needed** for a basic MCP server and add complexity.

## Comparison to rmcp (Official SDK)

| Aspect | prism-mcp-rs | rmcp |
|--------|--------------|------|
| **Maturity** | 5 months | Official, established |
| **Lines of Code** | 90 | 89 |
| **API Style** | Builder pattern | Macro-based |
| **Schema Generation** | Manual JSON | Automatic with schemars |
| **Argument Parsing** | Manual from HashMap | Type-safe with Parameters<T> |
| **Error Types** | Descriptive names | Similar functionality |
| **Dependencies** | 160 crates | Fewer crates |
| **Complexity** | Many optional features | Focused core |
| **Community** | Small (42 stars) | Official backing |
| **Production Ready** | Unknown/Unproven | Stable v0.14.0 |

## Recommendation

**NOT RECOMMENDED for production** despite passing all tests.

### Reasons
1. **Too new**: 5 months old with unknown stability
2. **Unproven**: Limited production deployments
3. **Small community**: 42 stars vs official SDK
4. **Feature bloat**: Advanced features add complexity without clear benefit
5. **No clear advantage**: rmcp (official) has better ergonomics with macros

### When to Consider
- Wait 1-2 years for maturity
- Monitor community adoption
- Evaluate if specific "enterprise" features (plugins, circuit breakers) become necessary
- Check if official rmcp doesn't meet future needs

### Current Winner
**rmcp** remains the best choice:
- Official Anthropic SDK
- Stable release (v0.14.0)
- Better ergonomics (macros)
- Proven in production
- No production blockers
